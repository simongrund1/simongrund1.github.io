      <description>This first post marks the launch of my website, with which I have been tinkering for some time now. From time to time, I will update the blog with new posts about topics related to quantitative psychology, statistical methods, R, Vim, and other things that interest me. So be sure to check back periodically!
In addition, you can find information about my publications and software projects. Whenever possible, I will update this information, including full-text versions of my articles and links to published and manuscript versions.</description>
